The unCLIP model in 🤗 Diffusers comes from kakaobrain's [karlo](https://github.com/kakaobrain/karlo).\n\nThe abstract from the paper is following:"", ""Focuses on the development and functionality of the CLIP model by OpenAI in 2021, which stands for Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training. CLIP generates abstract representations (embeddings) for input images or text, aiming to make similar images and texts have similar representations in high-dimensional space. This model's capability of aligning representations between images and text forms the basis for various applications such as image classification, search, and image segmentation, as discussed in the broader document about zero-shot image segmentation with CLIPSeg. \n\n [CLIP](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/en/model_doc/clip), which stands for **C**ontrastive **L**anguage–**I**mage **P**re-training, is a model developed by OpenAI in 2021. You can give CLIP an image or a piece of text, and CLIP will output an abstract *representation* of your input. This abstract representation, also called an *embedding*, is really just a vector (a list of numbers). You can think of this vector as a point in high-dimensional space. CLIP is trained so that the representations of similar pictures and texts are similar as well. This means that if we input an image and a text description that fits that image, the representations of the image and the text will be similar (i.e., the high-dimensional points will be close together)."", 'Focuses on an example of image classification using CLIP, showcasing how CLIP can classify images without specific training for that task. This example illustrates the power of CLIP in processing images and texts to generate abstract representations for classification purposes.
